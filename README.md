# EDA---Old-Car-Prediction
EDA for Old Car Prediction 

**Life Cycle Of Machine Learning Project**

From The above ML life cycle we are only follwing first three steps for EDA.

1. Understanding the Problem Statement : Here our primary goal is to find out the selling price depands on which features and which brand and type of car is famous for selling as a old car. 
2. Data Collection : Data is collected from the scarpping by cardekho website which is famous car selling online platform in India.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis : we have performed various univariate, multivariate and correlation comparsion with the help of charts and statistical methods. 

Following steps are not performed in the EDA. This will be done in the Machine Learning Model Deployment Process. 

4. Data Cleaning : We can say that much data cleaning is not required in the datasets. 

5. Data Pre Processing : Mostly we are doing feature engineering and removing unwanted and less important features form the dataset. 
 
6. Model Training : Applying different machine learning techniques we can find the comparsion with other techniques. 

7. Choose the best model : evaluating the result with the help of evaluation matric we can find out the best performing model.

**Conclusion form the EDA:** 
    There are outliers in the km_driven, engine, selling_price and max_power.

    Dealers are the highest sellers of the used cars.

    Skwness is found in some columns and impact on result is mentioned in the analysis. 

    Vechicle age has negative impact on the price. 

    Manual cars are mostly sold and automatic has higher selling average thatn manual cars. 

    Petrol is the most preferred car and diesal and lpg followd.

    Most of the data is available so no more cleaning required.
